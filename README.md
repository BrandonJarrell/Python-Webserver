# Python-Webserver
Proof of concept.
Basic demonstration of how to run a webserver on your local machine (will require port-forwarding) 

# Purpose
A lot of people I know search online for ways to host their own website. That topic is flooded with ads and companies looking to get you to use thier service.
I did not like that, I wanted to know how to do it myself. I personally want to do this for an ePortfolio or a future WebGL game I want to implement.
